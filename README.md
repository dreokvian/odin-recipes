This is my ODIN RECIPES

## What i learned so far

We need to try to always have a cycle of add and commit on git so that our couding journey naturally has its timeline.
```
git add
git commit -m "I have add A to solve B"
```

After this we can push to our GitHub repo only using push
```
git push origin main
```

We can also check and see log using status and log
```
git status
git log
```
