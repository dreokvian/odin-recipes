    <h1>Beef Yakiniku</h1>
    <img src="../img/beef-yakiniku.jpg" alt="Delicious beef yakiniku" width="300">
    <p>Yakiniku is a popular Japanese dish featuring thinly sliced beef grilled or stir-fried with a flavorful soy-based sauce, often enjoyed with rice and fresh vegetables for a balanced, savory-sweet meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thinly sliced beef (such as ribeye, sirloin, or short rib – about 400-500g / 1 lb, sliced very thin against the grain)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (low-sodium preferred)</li>
        <li>Mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)</li>
        <li>Sugar or honey</li>
        <li>Grated garlic (2-3 cloves)</li>
        <li>Grated fresh ginger (about 1-2 tsp)</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Toasted white sesame seeds (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the marinade: In a bowl, mix soy sauce, mirin, sugar/honey, grated garlic, grated ginger, and a splash of sesame oil until the sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Marinate the beef: Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade, toss to coat evenly, and let it sit for 15-30 minutes (or up to 2 hours in the fridge for deeper flavor).</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan, grill, or tabletop grill over high heat. Add a little oil if needed (sesame oil adds great aroma).</li>
        <li>Cook the marinated beef in batches in a single layer for 1-2 minutes per side until caramelized, browned, and just cooked through – avoid overcooking to keep it tender and juicy.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over steamed rice, garnish with toasted sesame seeds, and enjoy right away!</li>
    </ol>
