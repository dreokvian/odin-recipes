    <p>Omurice is a beloved Japanese-Western fusion dish featuring ketchup-seasoned fried rice (usually with chicken and veggies) wrapped in a soft, fluffy omelette.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked Japanese short-grain rice (about 2 cups, preferably day-old or cooled)</li>
        <li>Chicken thigh or breast, diced (about 100-150g)</li>
        <li>Onion, finely chopped (1/2 medium)</li>
        <li>Carrot, finely diced (optional, 1/4 cup)</li>
        <li>Green peas or mixed veggies (optional, 1/4 cup)</li>
        <li>Ketchup (4-6 tbsp, plus extra for topping)</li>
        <li>Butter or oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Large eggs (2-3 per serving, beaten with a pinch of salt)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the fried rice: Heat butter or oil in a pan over medium heat. Sauté diced chicken until cooked, add chopped onion (and carrot/peas if using), and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the rice: Stir in the cooked rice, breaking up clumps. Pour in ketchup (and soy/Worcestershire if using), mix well until the rice is evenly coated and heated through. Season with salt/pepper. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Prepare the omelette: Beat eggs with a pinch of salt. Heat a non-stick pan with a little oil or butter over medium-low heat. Pour in the eggs and gently swirl to make a thin, even layer. Cook until softly set (still slightly runny on top for fluffiness).</li>
        <li>Serve: Slide or flip onto a plate so the smooth side is up. Drizzle with extra ketchup in a zigzag pattern (and mayo if desired). Cut open at the table to reveal the rice inside—enjoy hot!</li>
    </ol>
